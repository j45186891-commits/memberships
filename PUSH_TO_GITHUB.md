```

## How to Push to GitHub

### Method 1: Using HTTPS (Recommended)

```bash
# Push to GitHub using HTTPS
git push origin main
```

When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials.

### Method 2: Using SSH (If configured)

```bash
# Set SSH URL (if not already set)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:j45186891-commits/memberships.git

# Push using SSH
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Using GitHub CLI (gh)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Then authenticate:
gh auth login

# Push using GitHub CLI
gh repo push
```

## Troubleshooting

### If push fails with authentication:

1. **Check your GitHub credentials**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name
   git config --global user.email
   ```

2. **Use personal access token**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
   - Use token as password when prompted

3. **Check remote URL**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### If you need to force push (be careful!):

```bash
git push origin main --force
```
