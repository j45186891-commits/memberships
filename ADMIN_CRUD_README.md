### Quick Reference

#### Example: Update an Event

const response = await fetch(`/api/events/${eventId}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`

    max_attendees: 150,
    price: 25.00
  })
});
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin**: Can create, read, update, and delete most content
- **Super Admin**: Full access including deletion of critical data
- **Member**: Read-only access to public content

### Deletion Safeguards

The system prevents accidental data loss:

- ❌ Cannot delete membership types in use
- ❌ Cannot delete events with registrations
- ❌ Cannot delete committees with active members
- ❌ Cannot delete forum categories with topics
- ❌ Cannot delete resources with active bookings
- ❌ Cannot delete surveys with responses
- ❌ Cannot delete sent email campaigns

**Recommendation**: Use deactivation (`is_active: false`) instead of deletion for items with dependencies.

### Audit Logging

All admin actions are automatically logged:
- User ID and role
- Action performed
- Entity type and ID
- Timestamp
- IP address

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Backend (Complete ✅)

All backend API endpoints are ready to use!

### For Frontend (To Do)

Update your React components to use the new endpoints:

1. **Add Edit Buttons** to data tables
2. **Add Delete Buttons** with confirmation dialogs
3. **Create Edit Forms** for each content type
4. **Add Success/Error Messages** for user feedback

Example component provided in `ADMIN_CRUD_GUIDE.md` section "Frontend Integration".

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

For each section, verify:

- [ ] Can create new items
- [ ] Can view all items
- [ ] Can view single item
- [ ] Can update items
- [ ] Can delete items (when no dependencies)
- [ ] Authorization works (admin vs super_admin)
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] Audit logs are created

### API Testing Tools

Use tools like:
- **Postman** - Import endpoints and test
- **cURL** - Command-line testing
- **Browser DevTools** - Network tab inspection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**403 Forbidden Error**
- Ensure user has admin or super_admin role
- Check JWT token is valid and not expired
- Verify user belongs to the correct organization

**Cannot Delete Item**
- Check if item has dependencies (registrations, members, etc.)
- Use deactivation instead: `PUT /:id` with `{ is_active: false }`
- Review deletion safeguards in documentation

**Validation Errors**
- Check all required fields are provided
- Verify data types match API expectations
- Review API documentation for field requirements

---

## 📞 Support

For questions or issues:

1. **Check Documentation**
   - ADMIN_CRUD_GUIDE.md for API reference
   - ADMIN_CRUD_CHANGES.md for implementation details

2. **Review Error Messages**
   - API responses include detailed error messages
   - Check server logs for additional context

3. **Audit Logs**
   - Review audit logs for action history
   - Verify operations are being logged correctly

---

## 🎊 Summary

**Before**: Had to manually edit database via terminal
```sql
psql -U user -d db
INSERT INTO events (...) VALUES (...);
UPDATE documents SET ... WHERE ...;
DELETE FROM surveys WHERE ...;
```

**After**: Use convenient API endpoints
```javascript
await api.post('/events', eventData);
await api.put(`/documents/${id}`, updates);
await api.delete(`/surveys/${id}`);
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ No more terminal database access needed
- ✅ Full audit trail of all changes
- ✅ Proper authorization and validation
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Safe deletion with dependency checks
