## 📊 API Endpoints Quick Reference

### Standard Pattern
```
GET    /api/{resource}           - List all
GET    /api/{resource}/:id       - Get one
POST   /api/{resource}           - Create
PUT    /api/{resource}/:id       - Update
DELETE /api/{resource}/:id       - Delete
```

### Example: Events
```javascript
// List all events
GET /api/events

// Get specific event
GET /api/events/event-id

// Create event
POST /api/events
{
  "title": "Annual Meeting",
  "location": "Main Hall",
  "start_date": "2025-12-15T10:00:00Z",
  ...
}

// Update event
PUT /api/events/event-id
{
  "max_attendees": 150,
  "price": 25.00
}

// Delete event
DELETE /api/events/event-id
```

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Use Deactivation Instead of Deletion**
   - For items with dependencies
   - Set `is_active: false`
   - Preserves data integrity

2. **Check Error Messages**
   - API provides clear error messages
   - Explains why operations fail
   - Suggests alternatives

3. **Review Audit Logs**
   - Track all admin actions
   - Monitor system changes
   - Investigate issues

4. **Test Before Production**
   - Test all endpoints
   - Verify authorization
   - Check deletion safeguards

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"403 Forbidden"**
- Check user role (must be admin or super_admin)
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Confirm organization membership

**"Cannot delete item"**
- Item has dependencies (registrations, members, etc.)
- Use deactivation instead: `PUT /:id` with `{ is_active: false }`
- See deletion safeguards in documentation

**"Validation error"**
- Check required fields
- Verify data types
- Review API documentation
